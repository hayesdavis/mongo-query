=mongo-query
Compiles SQL-like where clauses into query hashes acceptable for querying Mongo 
using the Mongo Ruby drivers and other wrappers (like MongoMapper).

This is very, very young and may not be complete, stable or work at all. Caveat 
emptor.

==Examples
  MongoQuery.compile("field_name = 1") 
    #=>{"field_name"=>1}

  MongoQuery.compile("id > 5 AND id < 10 AND name='hayes'")
    #=>{"id"=>{"$gt"=>5,"$lt"=>10},"name"=>"hayes"}

==Requires
